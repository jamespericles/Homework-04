        Welcome to my Code Quiz! There will be a series of 5 questions that
        appear on screen for you to answer. There is also a 2 minute timer so be
        quick! You can answer the questions by either clicking on the answer or
        pressing the number to the left of the question. Be careful, incorrect
        answers take away 10 seconds from the timer. Try your best and leave a
        highscore. When you're ready, click start to begin.
