This simple application is a short, five question quiz that utilizes Javascript technologies to create a timer, keep score, and update the HTML elements live. The user's remaining time and and score are appended to a high-score table at the end of the quiz. Besides this, the user is able to save their initials alongside their score and remaining time. Lastly, the user loses 10 seconds per incorrect answer.
